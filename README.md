# TicTacToe simulator with AI


This is a more complex and sophisticated version of TicTacToe as it uses artificial 
intelligence divided into 4 difficulties: easy, medium, hard and impossible. If this is your first 
"project" in python, first look at [Simple TicTacToe](https://github.com/Mxo01/Simple-TicTacToe)
to understand the reasoning behind it.

## Python installation (Linux only)

To run this code locally you need to install python in your pc 
by following these simple steps:

- First of all check if python is already installed

```bash
  python3 --version
```

- Then check for updates

```bash
  sudo apt update
```
    
- And if so, upgrade

```bash
  sudo apt upgrade
```

- Now you're ready to install python

```bash
  sudo apt install python3
```

## Screenshots

For screenshots see [Simple TicTacToe](https://github.com/Mxo01/Simple-TicTacToe),
it's pretty similar.
